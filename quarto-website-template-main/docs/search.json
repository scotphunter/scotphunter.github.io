    "text": "Doctoral Research.\nScot’s doctoral research focuses on examining the various ways in which patterns of contemporary migration (namely, white Christian newcomers migrating from Eastern Europe) may be impacting upon the lives of the Muslim community in the UK. Scot’s thesis involves the statistical analysis of the secondary longitudinal dataset Understanding Society and linked macro-data on local/occupational variations in contemporary migration from various ONS data sources. Scot’s focus lies in adopting an intersectional approach to explore Muslim outcomes. This focus stems from an interest to understand how the diverse social identities held by members of the Muslim community overlap in determining their position within the broader social structure. With this aim, Scot has explored innovative methodologies in his thesis, such as using intersectional multilevel models to look at how individuals are nested within their intersectional identity and how this may determine their access to resources and shape their experience of social inequalities. He presented on using this approach at the Social Stratification Seminar in 2022. He is supervised by Prof. Paul Lambert and Dr Marina Shapira.\nVisiting Scholar | Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC) in Migration and Integration | Toronto Metropolitan University.\nApril 2023 - March 2023\nAs a part of his doctoral research, Scot was awarded the ESRC funded Overseas Institutional Visit fund (£3000) to undertake research related to his PhD at an international institution. During his placement at Toronto Metropolitan University, Scot, Dr Akbar, and Stein Monteiro worked on a comparative analysis of Muslim women labour market outcomes in Canada and the UK. The paper produced from this research is currently being written. Scot also presented findings from his own doctoral research to the CERC team."
